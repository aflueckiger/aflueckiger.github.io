Due to the extensive development of information technology, agriculture is facing yet another significant change after the industrial revolution. For farmers, there is a myriad of challenges to cope with, yet also as many opportunities. This premise was the point of reference for the first Swiss farming hackathon in 2020, called Open Farming Hackdays.\nMuch hope lies in data-driven analyses. Data is valuable as everyone knows. As the wisdom goes, the more the data, the better. In many areas, however, there is no systematic data available. Thus, the main challenge is to collect data first before harvesting it for new insights. Unfortunately, much data is proprietary, meaning not free to use for everyone interested in it. Only open data enables innovation as any actors can make use of it by developing a multitude of solutions.\nIn farming, crowdsourced data about the spread of plant diseases or neophytes' prevalence could broadly foster new sustainable practices in the longer term. Against this backdrop, we developed an end-to-end prototype featuring the following:\n a mobile web application to record geo-referenced data on the field a cloud-based web service to aggregate the data at a central place a Python script to access, combine, and plot this data with any other data source of interest  ","date":1599264000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612010943,"objectID":"e37c672efa58d3bee5dc8a48a7aacd1b","permalink":"https://aflueckiger.github.io/project/open-farming-hackathon/","publishdate":"2020-09-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/open-farming-hackathon/","section":"project","summary":"A prototype to collect and analyze crowd-sourced data about plant diseases in agriculture.","tags":["agriculture","hackathon","open-data"],"title":"Open Farming Hackdays: Open Data Farming","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612010943,"objectID":"124201a103794add0dbd392b5335d852","permalink":"https://aflueckiger.github.io/teaching/ked2020/","publishdate":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/ked2020/","section":"teaching","summary":"In this hands-on seminar, bachelor students of social and cultural sciences learn the basics of programming among other essential technical skills.","tags":["Sociology","Computational Social Science","University of Lucerne"],"title":"KED2020","type":"teaching"},{"authors":["Maud Ehrmann","Matteo Romanello","Alex Flückiger","Simon Clematide"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612010943,"objectID":"c276e67f1c0b3fdad212fe053692979b","permalink":"https://aflueckiger.github.io/publication/ehrmann-2020/","publishdate":"2021-01-30T12:23:39.735237Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ehrmann-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Overview of CLEF HIPE 2020: Named Entity Recognition and Linking on Historical Newspapers","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
